#Connect SDK iOS, Lite Version
Connect SDK is an open source framework that connects your mobile apps with multiple TV platforms. Because most TV platforms support a variety of protocols, Connect SDK integrates and abstracts the discovery and connectivity between all supported protocols.

This repository contains the lite version of the Connect SDK project, and does not include support for platforms that require heavy and/or external dependencies. For the full Connect SDK, clone the [main repository](https://github.com/ConnectSDK/Connect-SDK-iOS).

For more information, visit our [website](http://www.connectsdk.com/).

* [General information about Connect SDK](http://www.connectsdk.com/discover/)
* [Platform documentation & FAQs](http://www.connectsdk.com/docs/ios/)
* [API documentation](http://www.connectsdk.com/apis/ios/)

##Dependencies
This project has the following dependencies:

* `libicucore.dylib`
* `libz.dylib`
* Other linker flags: `-ObjC`
* Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
* [Connect-SDK-iOS-Core](https://github.com/ConnectSDK/Connect-SDK-iOS-Core) submodule

##Including Connect SDK in your app
###Using CocoaPods
1. Add `pod "ConnectSDK/Core"` to your `Podfile`
2. Run `pod install`
3. Open the workspace file and run your project

You can use `pod "ConnectSDK"` to get the [full version](https://github.com/ConnectSDK/Connect-SDK-iOS).

###Without CocoaPods

1. Clone repository (`git clone https://github.com/ConnectSDK/Connect-SDK-iOS-Lite.git`)
2. Set up the submodules by running the following command (in the `Connect-SDK-iOS/` directory in this example): `git submodule update --init`
3. Open your project in Xcode
4. Locate the Connect SDK Xcode project in the Finder
5. Drag the Connect SDK Xcode project (`ConnectSDK.xcodeproj`) into your project's Xcode library
6. Navigate to your target's settings screen, then navigate to the "Build Phases" tab
7. Add the following in the "Link Binary With Libraries" section
 - `libConnectSDK.a`
 - `libz.dylib`
 - `libicucore.dylib`
8. Navigate to the "Build Settings" tab and add `-ObjC` to your target's "Other Linker Flags"

###Include Strings File for Localization (optional)
1. Locate the Connect SDK Xcode project in the Finder
2. Drag the ConnectSDKStrings folder into your project's library
3. You may make whatever changes you would like to the values and the SDK will use your strings file

## Tests

Connect SDK has tests for some parts of the code, and we are continuing to increase the test coverage. There are currently three types of tests:

Type | Target &amp; Scheme | Frameworks used | Uses network | Fast | Reliable
-----|---------------------|-----------------|:------------:|:----:|:-------:
Unit tests | `ConnectSDKTests` | `OCMock`, `OHHTTPStubs`, `XCTest` | **-** | **+** | **+**
Integration tests | `ConnectSDKIntegrationTests` | `Expecta`, `OCMock`, `Specta` | **-** | **+** | **+**
Acceptance (aka End-To-End) tests | `ConnectSDKAcceptanceTests` | `Expecta`, `OCMock`, `Specta` | **+** | **-** | **Â±**

* **Unit** tests are for small components and usually test one class/method. They use mocks to inject the dependencies.

* **Integration** tests verify the behavior of the whole Connect SDK, but without external environment (network and devices), so that they can be reliable and fast.

* **Acceptance** tests verify the end-to-end behavior of Connect SDK and real devices, so they won't work out of the box in a different environment. Some acceptance tests also expect certain properties of those devices, such as name or IP address, which should be altered to match your particular setup.

The required third-party test frameworks are already pre-built and included in the `core` submodule.

All of the test targets are compiled when the main `ConnectSDK` scheme is built, but only the unit tests are setup to run when testing the scheme. The other tests can be run by selecting the corresponding scheme.

##Limitations/Caveats

###Subtitles

- DLNA service supports `SRT` format only. Since there is no official specification for them, subtitles may not work on all DLNA-compatible devices. This feature has been tested and works on LG WebOS and Netcast TVs.
- Netcast service supports `SRT` format only, through DLNA.
- WebOS service supports `WebVTT` format only. Server providing subtitles should support CORS headers.
